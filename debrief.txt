Thank you for taking the time to complete our study.
While we know that individuals often rely on the advice of others, we were interested in whether people use advice from different sources more or less than others. 
In our study, participants received advice from one of three sources; from another person, from an algorithm or from an algorithm monitored by a human. To ensure that all participants received the same quality of advice, the advice given to all participants in each of the three conditions was the same and was generated by an algorithm. 
Our research will hopefully shed some light on how people use different sources of advice. To that end, your contribution will be very useful. Thank you very much for your participation.
