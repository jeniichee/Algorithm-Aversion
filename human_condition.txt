In this study, we will ask you to work on an estimation task, namely to **estimate the total bill** for a group of diners based on some information about the bill. <br>

This study will have two parts. In part one, you will work on ten practice trials to familiarise yourself with the task. After each trial, you will be shown the actual amount of the bill, your own estimate, and the estimate of another person.<br>

This person previously worked on the same task and estimated the total bill based on the same information that you have.<br>

This person will serve as your advisor in the next phase of the experiment.<br>

In part two, you will work on another ten estimates. After you make each estimate, you will also be given advice in the form of the estimate the person made for that bill.<br>

You will have the opportunity to earn additional rewards in part two by making accurate estimates. Please read all the information provided carefully.
