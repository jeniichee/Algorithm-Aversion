We are researchers from Queen's University, Belfast. We are investigating judgment and decision making. 
In this study, you'll be asked to make estimates based on information that you receive. You will then be given advice. After receiving this advice, you may make a final estimate.
The study should take __ minutes to complete. 
Your participation is entirely voluntary. You can end the survey at any point, for any reason, without penalty.

<u> **Thank you for considering participating in our study. It is important that you understand why the research is being carried out and what your participation will involve. Please read the following information and let the researchers know if you have any further questions.** </u><br>

   
<u> **Who is conducting the study?** </u><br>
The researchers are from Queen's University Belfast.<br>
   
<u> **What is the study about?** </u><br>
The study is being carried out to investigate judgement and decision-making.<br>
   
<u> **Do I have to take part?** </u><br>
Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw at any time during the study.<br>
   
<u> **What if I start to take part and then change my mind?** </u><br>
You may withdraw at any time without providing a reason. If you decide to stop the survey, your partial response will not be recorded as a matter of course, that is, we will destroy your partially filled-in questionnaires, and your data will not be transferred into the data file we will use to store the data electronically.  <br>
   
<u> **What will I be asked to do?** </u><br>
If you decide to take part in the study, you will be asked to read and complete a consent form and provide some information about your age and gender. <br>

We will ask you to work on two sets of ten estimation problems. The first ten problems will be a trial phase to allow you to become familiar with the task. <br>

In the first part of the study, you will be shown information about 10 bills from a restaurant and asked to make an estimate for cost of the total bill to familiarize you with the task. You will also be shown predictions made by an advisor. You will be told how close both estimates were to the actual total bill paid.  <br>

There are bonuses available in the study for making accurate estimations. These bonuses will be based on the accuracy of the estimates you make for the ten bills in part two of the study. <br>
 
In the second part of the study, you will be asked to estimate the total cost of ten bills in a restaurant. As before, you will receive information about a second set of ten bills in a restaurant. Once you have made your first estimate for each bill, you will be shown the estimate made by your advisor. You will then be given the chance to rejudge your original estimate and make a second estimate.<br>
   
<u> **Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential?** </u>  <br>
Yes, all information you provide through the questionnaires will be kept confidential. All data will be anonymous. <br>

This means there is no way for anybody to possibly link the data to you. This includes us as the researchers, which means that once you complete the study, we will not have the means to withdraw your data after this point. <br>

<u> **Why is this important?** </u><br>
Since the data we collect from you may be of interest to other researchers, we will publish it on a publicly accessible online data repository such as the Open Science Framework (https://www.osf.io), where it will remain indefinitely. That means, upon publication of the data set, anyone will have access to your anonymised (i.e., non-identifiable) data.   <br>
   
<u> **How long will it take?** </u> <br>
The duration of our study is approximately ?? minutes, on average, and you will receive __ for your time. There is an additional bonus of £2 available for accurate estimates.  <br>
   
<u> **What are the possible benefits of taking part?** </u><br>
There are no direct intended benefits to you for participating. However, it is hoped that the data gathered from your responses will contribute to further understanding of the subject area and inform future research.<br>
  
Our research depends crucially on the generous help of participants like yourself. We hope that you can assist us with this project.<br>
   
<u> **What will happen to the results of the research?** </u><br>
The results will be written up in a Doctoral thesis.   <br>
   
<u> **Who is organising and funding the research?** </u><br>
This study is being organised by researchers at Queen's University Belfast. It is being conducted as part of a PhD in Psychology. <br> 
   
<u> **Who has reviewed the study?** </u><br>
This study has been reviewed by the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Ethics Committee.<br>


If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact **Dr Thomas Schultze** at <u>t.schultze@qub.ac.uk</u>.<br>
Thank you for your interest in this study and for taking the time to read through this information.<br>

All the information shown in this study represents real data from a restaurant.

First, you will make estimates for 10 bills. You will base your estimates on the data you are given. For each estimation task, you will see the following screen:

Next, you will complete 10 practice estimates. This is just to give you experience before you complete your 10 actual estimates.

main_task_instructions = """
In part two of the study, you will make your 10 official estimates. On each trial, you will see the data table with information about each bill. You will then make a **first estimate** of the total bill. We will also ask you to rate your **confidence** in the accuracy of this initial estimate.<br>

On the next page, you will see your own initial estimate and your advisor's estimate for the total bill.<br>

You will then make a **second estimate**. If you want to retain your initial estimate, simply enter the same number again. Please also indicate your **confidence** in the accuracy of your final estimate.<br> 

You will not receive any feedback in this part of the study.<br> 

**Important**: <u> **If you perform well in this part of the study, you will be eligible for an additional bonus payment of £2. Whether you will receive that bonus depends on the accuracy of your second estimates. The closer your second estimates are to the true values, the more likely it is that you will earn the bonus payment.** </u>

debrief = """
While we know that individuals often rely on the advice of others, we were interested in whether people use advice from different sources more or less than others. 
In our study, participants received advice from one of three sources; from another person, from an algorithm or from an algorithm monitored by a human. To ensure that all participants received the same quality of advice, the advice given to all participants in each of the three conditions was the same and was generated by an algorithm. 
Our research will hopefully shed some light on how people use different sources of advice. To that end, your contribution will be very useful. Thank you very much for your participation.

In this study, we will ask you to work on an estimation task, namely to **estimate the total bill** for a group of diners based on some information about the bill.<br>

This study will have two parts. In part one, you will work on ten practice trials to familiarise yourself with the task. After each trial, you will be shown the actual amount of the bill, your own estimate, and the estimate of an algorithm.<br> 

This algorithm was designed to predict the total bill based on the same information that you have.<br>

This algorithm will serve as your advisor in the next phase of the experiment.<br>

In part two, you will work on another ten estimates. After you make each estimate, you will also be given advice in the form of the estimate the algorithm made for that bill.<br>
