In this task, you will be asked to estimate the amount of the tip given for each bill in a restaurant. You will be given information about each bill to help you make each estimate. In addition, you will also be provided with an estimate which has been calculated by an algorithm. 
You will have the opportunity to earn additional rewards by making accurate estimates. Please read all the information provided carefully. 

You will be given information about each specific bill, for example, the number of people who were in the party and the time of day that they ate at. You will use this information to help you estimate how much each table paid as a tip. 

After you make each estimate, you will also be given advice in the form of an estimate made for each bill. The advice is the estimate of an algorithm. This algorithm was designed to predict the size of the tips based on the same information that you have.
