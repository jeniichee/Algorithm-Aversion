In this task, you will be asked to estimate the amount of the tip given for each bill in a restaurant. You will be given information about each bill to help you make each estimate. In addition, you will also be provided with an estimate which has been calculated by a hybrid model which averages the estimates of an algorithm and the restaurant manager.
You will have the opportunity to earn additional rewards by making accurate estimates. Please read all the information provided carefully. 

You will be given information about each specific bill, for example, the number of people who were in the party and the time of day that they ate at. You will use this information to help you estimate how much each table paid as a tip. 

In addition to the table of information, you will also be shown a prediction made for each bill by a hybrid forecasting model developed by a restaurant.
This hybrid model is designed to forecast the amount that each set of diners may pay as a tip by averaging the estimates calculated by an algorithm and the estimates made by the restaurant manager for each bill. 
The algorithm is based on hundreds of bills, using the same categories of data that you receive. This is a sophisticated algorithm, put together by thoughtful analysis. The restaurant manager has more than five yearsâ€™ experience.
